# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm Kevin Nengou with dev name ( Kevelino ), a software development enthusiast, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my GitHub profile.

## About me

I'm passionate about software development and creating innovative solutions. With a background in computer science and hands-on experience in web development, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and explore new technologies.

Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, from dynamic websites to mobile applications. My approach is to combine a solid understanding of development principles with boundless creativity to solve problems.

I'm comfortable with several programming languages, including JavaScript, Python and C++, and have hands-on experience with popular frameworks such as React, Astro and Django. My current interest is in artificial intelligence and machine learning, areas in which I'm looking to deepen my knowledge.

Outside of coding, I'm a sports, music and film fan, a coffee lover and a strong advocate of knowledge sharing within the developer community. I firmly believe that software development is a continuous learning adventure, and I'm delighted to contribute to this dynamic ecosystem.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, would like to collaborate on an exciting project or simply discuss development and technology.
